Let's try to send and receive at the same time.

There are two experiments:
- experiment-1: spinn (core-1) receives sdp and send the reply directly
- experiment-2: spinn (core-1) receives an sdp and trigger core-2 to start streaming sdp to host 

Note: 
- in both case, we use iptag-1 and use sdp port-7 to stop core-1
- use sendSDP.py for sending SDPs from host-PC to spinn
- use qt/pkt_length_cntr to receives SDPs from spinn
