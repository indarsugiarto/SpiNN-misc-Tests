After some experiment, either using python or qt/c++, it seems that 
the maximum throughput is about 5.7MiB per second.

Also, it seems that using that bandwidth, no packet drop/loss during transmission
(i.e., the whole 272 bytes are received correctly).

!!!!!! HOWEVER, IT ONLY WORKS FOR CHIP 0,0 !!!!!!!

If we push higher, then:
- sark/scamp will raise SCW error
- there will be packets missing during udp transmission

Also, using more than 1 core to stream sdp at the same time will produce
big SWC error while the throughput seems to be the same (i.e., no improvement).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using other chip than <0,0>, then the max throughput (without SWC error)
is 1.1MiB per second.
