We want to see the maximum throughput for sending sdp via udp on ethernet.
Both handshaking and non-handshaking are evaluated.

Once the spiNNaker receives an SDP, it copies the 272-bytes SDP content into its DTCM.

Result:
- With handshaking:
  max throughput is almost 800KBps
- With non-handshaking
  - delay 1ms ( via time.sleep(0.000001) ) can go up to 5MBps
  - delay counter 720 can go up to 10MBps
