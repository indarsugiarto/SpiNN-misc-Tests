Don't forget to boot the Spin3 first!

- To load the profiler program on Spin3:
$ ./run.profiler

- To stop the profiler program:
$ ./stop.profiler

- To read current PLL setting in a chip (eq. chip <1,0>):
$ ./readSpiNNpll.py -x1 -y0

- To alter frequency of a chip (eq. chip <1,1> to be 150MHz):
$ ./setSpiNNFreq.py -x1 -y1 -f150

- To run example programs (when profiler is running):
  - worst case scenario:
    $ ./run.wc
  - path tracer demo:
    $ ./run.ptDemo
