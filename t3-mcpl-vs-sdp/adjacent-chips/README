Want to measure time the processing time of mcpl and sdp for two adjacent chips.
Here is the result:

[12:13:29]-[0,0,1:0] Will send 680000 MCPL and 10000 SDP data...
[12:13:30]-[0,0,1:0] [Sender] Starting phase-1......
[12:13:32]-[0,0,1:0] [Sender] Wait for final ack...
[12:13:32]-[0,0,1:0] [Sender] Ack is received. Starting phase-2...
[12:13:34]-[0,0,1:0] [Sender] Wait for final ack...
[12:13:34]-[0,0,1:0] [Sender] Ack is received. Signal finish...
[12:13:34]-[0,0,1:0] [Sender] t1 = 452776070, t2 = 465935617 clk
[12:13:34]-[1,0,1:0] [Recvr] t1 = 452828734, t2 = 465940733 clk
[12:13:34]-[1,0,1:0] [Processing-time] 56.603577-us per byte for MCPL, 58.242584-us per byte for SDP
